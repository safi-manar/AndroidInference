        \n<b>In order for you to understand your participation in this study, please read this
        entire disclosure.</b>

        \n\nThis app is part of a study to explore the possibility of inferring user information from
        benign smartphone sensors, like the step counter or compass.

        \n\nThis app will silently collect periodic sensor measurements.It will also collect GPS data.
        All collected data will be kept on our
        secure servers. The data will be maintained for possible future research. Only anonymous,
        non-identifiable data (ie, not GPS) would be shared with other researchers. Data collection
        will have minimal impact on your phone performance and battery life.
        \n\nYour participation in this study will involve <b>1 required survey</b> in addition to
        brief daily optional surveys.

        \n\nFor Amazon MTURK participants:

        \n\n- $0.25 for downloading and installing the app
        \n- $1 for each daily survey you submit
        \n- $2 for 1 week complete participation in the study


        \n\nThis research will not benefit you directly. However, it will indirectly benefit you and other
        smartphone users by informing system designers of the data implications from benign sensors.

        \n\nSome of the research questions may make you uncomfortable or upset. You are free to decline
        to answer and stop the study at any time. You may also uninstall the app at any time to stop
        the study.

        \n\nIf you any survey content objectionable, you are free to abstain from answering or entirely
        ending your participation in the study.

        \n\nThe risks for this study are minimal: these involve a potential breach of confidentiality for
        GPS data and other location data. We will encrypt data to decrease the probability of such a
        breach.

        \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about your rights and treatment as a research subject,
        you may contact the office of UC Berkeley\'s Committee for the Protection of Human
        Subjects, at 510-642-7461 or subjects@berkeley.edu. Reference: CPHS# 2015-11-8097
