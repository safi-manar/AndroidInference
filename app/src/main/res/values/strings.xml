        As part of your participation in the UCB Sensor Inference Study, we would like to give you a short survey
        that will take 1-2 minutes of your time. \n\n

        Though every daily survey is optional, these surveys greatly benefit our research and maximize your participation
        in our study. You can manually check for daily survey eligibility by opening our app anytime and pressing the
        status button. \n
        Would you like to complete today\'s survey now?

    <string name="consent_title">Consent to Participate in Research\n Understanding Smartphone Sensors</string>
    <string name="consent_message">
        \n<b>In order for you to understand your participation in this study, please read this entire
        disclosure:</b>

        \n\n<u>Introduction</u>
        \nThis app is part of a study conducted at UC Berkeley and the International Computer Science
        Institute (ICSI), led by Dr. Serge Egelman, to explore the possibility of inferring user information
        from benign smartphone sensors, like the step counter or compass. You must be 18 years of
        age or older and own an Android phone running a recent version of Android.

        \n\n<u>Procedures</u>
        \nThis app will silently collect periodic sensor measurements: device specifications, compass,
        accelerometer, gyroscope, battery state, screen state, proximity (distance an object is from the
        screen), barometric pressure, relative humidity, ambient temperature, pedometer counts, and
        luminosity (how bright the environment around the phone is). It will also collect GPS data. Data
        collection will have minimal impact on your phone performance and battery life. Your
        participation in this study will involve one required introductory survey, in addition to brief
        daily optional surveys. These surveys will ask you about your demographics and daily activities,
        so that we can see if they could have been predicted based on the captured sensor data. The
        first survey will appear after you agree to participate in this study. Additional daily surveys will
        appear as notifications from this application.

        \n\n<u>Total Time Commitment</u>
        \nTotal active time commitment will be under 15 minutes: approximately 5 minutes to complete
        the initial survey, 1 minute for each daily survey, 1 minute for the exit survey, and then a week
        of passively keeping our app running. We will ask you to complete 6 daily surveys, at most.

        \n\n<u>Benefits / Risks</u>
        \nThis research will not benefit you directly. However, it will indirectly benefit you and other
        smartphone users by informing system designers of the data implications from benign sensors.

        \n\nSome of the research questions may make you uncomfortable or upset. You are free to decline
        \nto answer and stop the study at any time. You may also uninstall the app at any time to stop
        the study.

        \n\nIf you find any survey content objectionable, you may choose to abstain from answering, or
        \neven end your participation in the study entirely.
        The risks for this study are minimal: these involve a potential breach of confidentiality for GPS
        data and other location data. We will encrypt data to decrease the probability of such a breach.

        \n\n<u>Confidentiality</u>
        \nAll collected data will be kept on our secure servers. The data will be maintained for possible
        future research. Only anonymous, non-identifiable data (i.e., not GPS) will be potentially shared
        with other researchers.

        \n\n<u>Rights</u>
        \nParticipation in research is completely voluntary. You have the right to decline to participate or
        to withdraw at any point in this study without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are
        otherwise entitled.

        \n\n<u>Contact Information</u>
        \nIf you have any questions or concerns about your rights and treatment as a research subject,
        you may contact the office of UC Berkeley\'s Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects,
        at 510-642- 7461 or subjects@berkeley.edu. Reference: CPHS# 2015-11- 8097
